# People You Might Know â€“ Social Network Recommendation Algorithm
## Overview
A Python-based recommendation engine that suggests potential friends based on mutual connections. This project demonstrates data ingestion, preprocessing, and scalable algorithm design with real-world social network data.

## Features
- Mutual friend scoring algorithm
- CSV data import and preprocessing
- Scalable and extensible Python implementation

## Technologies
- Python (standard libraries)
- Pandas (for data handling, optional if you used it)

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Load social network CSV data
3. Run friendrec.py to get friend suggestions

## Future Work
- Enhance algorithm with weighted scoring
- Integrate with graph databases for better performance
