# People-You-Might-Know-Social-Network-Recommendation-Algorithm

## Overview
A Python-based recommendation engine that suggests potential friends based on mutual connections. This project demonstrates data ingestion, preprocessing, and scalable algorithm design with real-world social network data.

## Features
Mutual friend scoring algorithm

CSV data import and preprocessing

Scalable and extensible Python implementation

Technologies
Python (standard libraries)

Pandas (for data handling, optional if you used it)

Usage
Clone the repo

Load social network CSV data

Run friend_recommendation.py to get friend suggestions

Future Work
Enhance algorithm with weighted scoring

Integrate with graph databases for better performance
